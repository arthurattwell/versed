        <h3>To One Who Has Been Long in City Pent</h3>

        <p>To one who has been long in city pent,<br>
        &emsp;&emsp;‘Tis very sweet to look into the fair<br>
        &emsp;&emsp;And open face of heaven,—to breathe a prayer<br>
        Full in the smile of the blue firmament.<br>
        Who is more happy, when, with heart’s content,<br>
        &emsp;&emsp;Fatigued he sinks into some pleasant lair<br>
        &emsp;&emsp;Of wavy grass, and reads a debonair<br>
        And gentle tale of love and languishment?</p>

        <p>Returning home at evening, with an ear<br>
        &emsp;&emsp;Catching the notes of Philomel,—an eye<br>
        Watching the sailing cloudlet’s bright career,<br>
        &emsp;&emsp;He mourns that day so soon has glided by:<br>
        E’en like the passage of an angel’s tear<br>
        &emsp;&emsp;That falls through the clear ether silently.</p>

        <h3>Gerontion</h3>

        <p>&emsp;Thou hast nor youth nor age<br>
        &emsp;But as it were an after dinner sleep<br>
        &emsp;Dreaming of both.</p>

        <p>Here I am, an old man in a dry month,<br>
        Being read to by a boy, waiting for rain.<br>
        I was neither at the hot gates<br>
        Nor fought in the warm rain<br>
        Nor knee deep in the salt marsh, heaving a cutlass,<br>
        Bitten by flies, fought.<br>
        My house is a decayed house,<br>
        And the jew squats on the window sill, the owner,<br>
        Spawned in some estaminet of Antwerp,<br>
        Blistered in Brussels, patched and peeled in London.<br>
        The goat coughs at night in the field overhead;<br>
        Rocks, moss, stonecrop, iron, merds.<br>
        The woman keeps the kitchen, makes tea,<br>
        Sneezes at evening, poking the peevish gutter.</p>

        <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I an old man,<br>
        A dull head among windy spaces.<br>
        Signs are taken for wonders. “We would see a sign”:<br>
        The word within a word, unable to speak a word,<br>
        Swaddled with darkness. In the juvescence of the year<br>
        Came Christ the tiger</p>

        <p>In depraved May, dogwood and chestnut, flowering Judas,<br>
        To be eaten, to be divided, to be drunk<br>
        Among whispers; by Mr. Silvero<br>
        With caressing hands, at Limoges<br>
        Who walked all night in the next room;<br>
        By Hakagawa, bowing among the Titians;<br>
        By Madame de Tornquist, in the dark room<br>
        Shifting the candles; Fraulein von Kulp<br>
        Who turned in the hall, one hand on the door. Vacant shuttles<br>
        Weave the wind. I have no ghosts,<br>
        An old man in a draughty house<br>
        Under a windy knob.</p>

        <p>After such knowledge, what forgiveness? Think now<br>
        History has many cunning passages, contrived corridors<br>
        And issues, deceives with whispering ambitions,<br>
        Guides us by vanities. Think now<br>
        She gives when our attention is distracted<br>
        And what she gives, gives with such supple confusions<br>
        That the giving famishes the craving. Gives too late<br>
        What’s not believed in, or if still believed,<br>
        In memory only, reconsidered passion. Gives too soon<br>
        Into weak hands, what’s thought can be dispensed with<br>
        Till the refusal propagates a fear. Think<br>
        Neither fear nor courage saves us. Unnatural vices<br>
        Are fathered by our heroism. Virtues<br>
        Are forced upon us by our impudent crimes.<br>
        These tears are shaken from the wrath-bearing tree.</p>

        <p>The tiger springs in the new year. Us he devours. Think at last<br>
        We have not reached conclusion, when I<br>
        Stiffen in a rented house. Think at last<br>
        I have not made this show purposelessly<br>
        And it is not by any concitation<br>
        Of the backward devils.<br>
        I would meet you upon this honestly.<br>
        I that was near your heart was removed therefrom<br>
        To lose beauty in terror, terror in inquisition.<br>
        I have lost my passion: why should I need to keep it<br>
        Since what is kept must be adulterated?<br>
        I have lost my sight, smell, hearing, taste and touch:<br>
        How should I use it for your closer contact?</p>

        <p>These with a thousand small deliberations<br>
        Protract the profit of their chilled delirium,<br>
        Excite the membrane, when the sense has cooled,<br>
        With pungent sauces, multiply variety<br>
        In a wilderness of mirrors. What will the spider do,<br>
        Suspend its operations, will the weevil<br>
        Delay? De Bailhache, Fresca, Mrs. Cammel, whirled<br>
        Beyond the circuit of the shuddering Bear<br>
        In fractured atoms. Gull against the wind, in the windy straits<br>
        Of Belle Isle, or running on the Horn,<br>
        White feathers in the snow, the Gulf claims,<br>
        And an old man driven by the Trades<br>
        To a sleepy corner.</p>

        <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Tenants of the house,<br>
        Thoughts of a dry brain in a dry season.</p>
