        <h1>Versed</h1>

        <p><strong>Typographic control for verse, poetry, hymns and&nbsp;lyrics</strong></p>

        <p>Proper verse layout has two specific needs:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Long lines that run over should be indented.</li>
            <li>Blocks of verse should be centered on their longest line.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>You should also be able to target individual lines with CSS. For instance, to add line numbers.</p>

        <p>The only way to get this effect with sensible HTML is to wrap each line in a span (with its own class), and to write CSS to control runover lines and centering. That's a lot of work to do by hand. Versed does it for you in the browser.</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Link to <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arthurattwell/versed/master/versed.js"><code>versed.js</code></a> and <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arthurattwell/versed/master/versed.css"><code>versed.css</code></a> on your page.</li>
            <li>Mark up your verse in HTML with <code>p</code>s and <code>br</code>s, and wrap each piece in a <code>div class="versed"</code>. You can do this easily in markdown, too.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Samples</h2>

        <p>Here's a short poem with indented lines.</p>

        <!-- HTML style with no line breaks -->
        <div class="versed">

            <h3>To One Who Has Been Long in City Pent</h3>

            <p>To one who has been long in city pent,<br />&emsp;&emsp;‘Tis very sweet to look into the fair<br /> &emsp;&emsp;And open face of heaven,—to breathe a prayer<br /> Full in the smile of the blue firmament.<br /> Who is more happy, when, with heart’s content,<br /> &emsp;&emsp;Fatigued he sinks into some pleasant lair<br /> &emsp;&emsp;Of wavy grass, and reads a debonair<br /> And gentle tale of love and languishment?</p>

            <p>Returning home at evening, with an ear<br/> &emsp;&emsp;Catching the notes of Philomel,—an eye<br/> Watching the sailing cloudlet’s bright career,<br> &emsp;&emsp;He mourns that day so soon has glided by:<br> E’en like the passage of an angel’s tear<br> &emsp;&emsp;That falls through the clear ether silently.</p>

        </div>

        <p>And here's a longer poem with line numbers.</p>

        <!-- HTML style with unclosed br tags -->
        <div class="versed versed-number-lines">

            <h3>Gerontion</h3>

            <p>&emsp;Thou hast nor youth nor age<br>
            &emsp;But as it were an after dinner sleep<br>
            &emsp;Dreaming of both.</p>

            <p>Here I am, an old man in a dry month,<br>
            Being read to by a boy, waiting for rain.<br>
            I was neither at the hot gates<br>
            Nor fought in the warm rain<br>
            Nor knee deep in the salt marsh, heaving a cutlass,<br>
            Bitten by flies, fought.<br>
            My house is a decayed house,<br>
            And the jew squats on the window sill, the owner,<br>
            Spawned in some estaminet of Antwerp,<br>
            Blistered in Brussels, patched and peeled in London.<br>
            The goat coughs at night in the field overhead;<br>
            Rocks, moss, stonecrop, iron, merds.<br>
            The woman keeps the kitchen, makes tea,<br>
            Sneezes at evening, poking the peevish gutter.</p>

            <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I an old man,<br>
            A dull head among windy spaces.<br>
            Signs are taken for wonders. “We would see a sign”:<br>
            The word within a word, unable to speak a word,<br>
            Swaddled with darkness. In the juvescence of the year<br>
            Came Christ the tiger</p>

            <p>In depraved May, dogwood and chestnut, flowering Judas,<br>
            To be eaten, to be divided, to be drunk<br>
            Among whispers; by Mr. Silvero<br>
            With caressing hands, at Limoges<br>
            Who walked all night in the next room;<br>
            By Hakagawa, bowing among the Titians;<br>
            By Madame de Tornquist, in the dark room<br>
            Shifting the candles; Fraulein von Kulp<br>
            Who turned in the hall, one hand on the door. Vacant shuttles<br>
            Weave the wind. I have no ghosts,<br>
            An old man in a draughty house<br>
            Under a windy knob.</p>

            <p>After such knowledge, what forgiveness? Think now<br>
            History has many cunning passages, contrived corridors<br>
            And issues, deceives with whispering ambitions,<br>
            Guides us by vanities. Think now<br>
            She gives when our attention is distracted<br>
            And what she gives, gives with such supple confusions<br>
            That the giving famishes the craving. Gives too late<br>
            What’s not believed in, or if still believed,<br>
            In memory only, reconsidered passion. Gives too soon<br>
            Into weak hands, what’s thought can be dispensed with<br>
            Till the refusal propagates a fear. Think<br>
            Neither fear nor courage saves us. Unnatural vices<br>
            Are fathered by our heroism. Virtues<br>
            Are forced upon us by our impudent crimes.<br>
            These tears are shaken from the wrath-bearing tree.</p>

            <p>The tiger springs in the new year. Us he devours. Think at last<br>
            We have not reached conclusion, when I<br>
            Stiffen in a rented house. Think at last<br>
            I have not made this show purposelessly<br>
            And it is not by any concitation<br>
            Of the backward devils.<br>
            I would meet you upon this honestly.<br>
            I that was near your heart was removed therefrom<br>
            To lose beauty in terror, terror in inquisition.<br>
            I have lost my passion: why should I need to keep it<br>
            Since what is kept must be adulterated?<br>
            I have lost my sight, smell, hearing, taste and touch:<br>
            How should I use it for your closer contact?</p>

            <p>These with a thousand small deliberations<br>
            Protract the profit of their chilled delirium,<br>
            Excite the membrane, when the sense has cooled,<br>
            With pungent sauces, multiply variety<br>
            In a wilderness of mirrors. What will the spider do,<br>
            Suspend its operations, will the weevil<br>
            Delay? De Bailhache, Fresca, Mrs. Cammel, whirled<br>
            Beyond the circuit of the shuddering Bear<br>
            In fractured atoms. Gull against the wind, in the windy straits<br>
            Of Belle Isle, or running on the Horn,<br>
            White feathers in the snow, the Gulf claims,<br>
            And an old man driven by the Trades<br>
            To a sleepy corner.</p>

            <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Tenants of the house,<br>
            Thoughts of a dry brain in a dry season.</p>

        </div>

        <p>Here's a simple classic with shorter lines.</p>

        <!-- HTML style with br tags on new lines -->
        <div class="versed">
            <h3>I Wandered Lonely as a Cloud</h3>
            <p>I wandered lonely as a cloud
                <br> That floats on high o'er vales and hills,
                <br> When all at once I saw a crowd,
                <br> A host, of golden daffodils;
                <br> Beside the lake, beneath the trees,
                <br> Fluttering and dancing in the breeze.</p>
            <p>Continuous as the stars that shine
                <br> And twinkle on the milky way,
                <br> They stretched in never-ending line
                <br> Along the margin of a bay:
                <br> Ten thousand saw I at a glance,
                <br> Tossing their heads in sprightly dance.</p>
            <p>The waves beside them danced; but they
                <br> Out-did the sparkling waves in glee:
                <br> A poet could not but be gay,
                <br> In such a jocund company:
                <br> I gazed—and gazed—but little thought
                <br> What wealth the show to me had brought:</p>
            <p>For oft, when on my couch I lie
                <br> In vacant or in pensive mood,
                <br> They flash upon that inward eye
                <br> Which is the bliss of solitude;
                <br> And then my heart with pleasure fills,
                <br> And dances with the daffodils.</p>
        </div>

        <p>Versed works fine for little extracts, too:</p>

        <div class="versed">
            <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Tenants of the house,<br>
            Thoughts of a dry brain in a dry season.</p>
        </div>
